**GymGauge: Automatic Workout Detection and Tracking Model**

GymGauge is a machine learning-powered model that automatically detects and tracks workouts performed in the gym using sensor data. With an accuracy of 95%, this project processes raw data, applies outlier detection, and uses advanced algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVMs, and Random Forest for exercise classification. It also features a custom algorithm for real-time repetition counting, providing users with precise and reliable workout tracking.
